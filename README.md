## NOTE: THE RESUTLS are on the results.pdf file. They are shown as a table for each of the queries, method, and wiki dump.

## Data Parsing: You can find the data parsing code in pullingxml_sequentially.py

## Data Cleaning and Querying: You can find the code that cleans and queries the data in clean_and_query.py. It starts with a libray of functions that we wrote to enable us to solve the problem.
